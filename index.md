Hi, My name is Arthur Bartkevich and I am a freelance software developer. I have more than 10 years of experience in the industry and much more than that as a hobby.

I am a generalist. I view programming languages and frameworks as tools, and there is always the best tool for the job. I am also a big fan of efficiency; therefore, performance tuning and automation are among many things I enjoy and do very well.

I am a full-stack web developer. Besides frontend, backend, mobile and desktop development, I do software architecture, database tuning, deployment automation, provisioning, server administration and development process optimisation.

I pride myself on being on time and precise with my work. In my work, I am also constantly striving for simplicity and efficiency. I believe that the most important skill a software developer can have is the ability to learn quickly and efficiently. In most cases, I prefer documentation to books.

I started of as a corporate employee, moved on to startups, then &mdash; to a leadership position in the next startup, and now I am mostly helping startups to bootstrap their applications.

If you need someone like me, [Contact me.](mailto:artur@bratkevich.com)
