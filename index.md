Hello! My name is Arthur Bartkevich and I am a freelance software developer with more than 10 years of experience in the industry. 

I enjoy learning and discovering new technologies to make my work more efficient. I believe that software development begins with efficient processes, and the
most important skill a software developer can have is the ability to learn.

I am always looking for new challenges. I can build almost anything from ground up, provision servers, deploy and automate all repetitive tasks. 

I offer a wide variety of services:

 - Backend development, frontend development, and mobile development
 - Database administration
 - Server administration, provisioning and automation
 - Application and database performance tuning
 - Consulting

I am available for long- or short-term hire. If you need someone like me, send me an email to [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) or contact me here:
