<p>Hi, My name is Arthur Bartke­vich and I am a free­lance soft­ware devel­op­er. I have more than 10 years of expe­ri­ence in the indus­try and much more than that as a hobby.</p>

<p>I am a gen­er­al­ist. I view pro­gram­ming lan­guages and frame­works as tools, and there is always the best tool for the job. I am also a big fan of effi­cien­cy; there­fore, per­for­mance tun­ing and automa­tion are among many things I enjoy and do very well.</p>

<p>I am a ful­l-s­tack web devel­op­er. Besides fron­tend, back­end, mobile and desk­top devel­op­ment, I do soft­ware archi­tec­ture, data­base tun­ing, deploy­ment automa­tion, pro­vi­sion­ing, server admin­is­tra­tion and devel­op­ment process optimisation.</p>

<p>I pride myself on being on time and pre­cise with my work. In my work, I am also con­stantly striv­ing for sim­plic­ity and effi­cien­cy. I believe that the most impor­tant skill a soft­ware devel­oper can have is the abil­ity to learn quickly and effi­cient­ly. In most cas­es, I pre­fer doc­u­men­ta­tion to books.</p>

<p>I started of as a cor­po­rate employ­ee, moved on to star­tups, then — to a lead­er­ship posi­tion in the next star­tup, and now I am mostly help­ing star­tups to boot­strap their applications.</p>
